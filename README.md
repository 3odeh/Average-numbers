# Average-numbers

This is an x86 assembly language program that prompts the user to input the number of integers to be summed and averaged, and then prompts the user to enter each integer. The program calculates the sum and average of the entered integers and displays the results. The program also includes error messages for invalid input, such as entering a non-numeric character or a zero for the number of integers. The program uses the MS-DOS interrupt 21h to handle input and output, and uses loops and conditional statements to process the input and perform the calculations.
